# LMC_RS
Little Man Computer, written in Rust.

## What is LMC?
Little Man Computer (LMC) is a computer modelled by an instruction set, and is commonly used to teach the bare concepts of programming in an Assembly language, and how such instructions could interface with the hardware.

## Why?
This is a project to help further familiarise myself with Rust.

## Thanks
I wanted to thank tomc1998. While doing this project, I came across his repository for a rust-based LMC. I was disheartened that they had already beaten me to the concept, but in the end it inspired me to keep going, and I even incorperated some of the concepts they laid out in their own project. Reading through their work has taught me a lot.
