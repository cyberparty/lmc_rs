# LMC_RS
Little Man Computer, written in Rust.

## What is LMC?
Little Man Computer (LMC) is a computer modelled by an instruction set, and is commonly used to teach the bare concepts of programming in an Assembly language, and how such instructions could interface with the hardware.

## Why?
This is a project to help further familiarise myself with Rust.
The entire project scope is undecided as of current, but the main goal will be that it can run a set of LMC instructions provided to it, emulating how the LMC would execute these instructions internally.
The project may be extended at some point to include a compiler, which will compile the instructions provided to it into their decimal representations and subsequently run them.
